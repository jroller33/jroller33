<h2>👨🏻‍💻 About Me</h2>

I'm currently in a full-stack coding bootcamp. Some of the projects and assignments I've worked on recently are still on my GitHub, but most of the projects we did at the beginning aren't because I'm redoing them. This page is constantly changing so check back regularly.

<h2>🔗 Links:</h3>
Here's some links to projects that are finished (or mostly finished):<br/>

### ⚠️Note about Heroku⚠️:
If you experience a 5-10 second lag after clicking the link to an app I've deployed on Heroku, it is because I'm currently using the free version. The server for an app on Heroku isn't listening at all times, because Heroku kills it after ~10 minutes if it doesn't receive a request. So when you click the link, the lag is from Heroku spinning-up the server so that it can receive your request and respond.<br/>
